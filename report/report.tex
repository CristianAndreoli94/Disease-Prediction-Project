\abstract{  
    This study addresses the complex challenge of deciphering the relationships between symptoms and diseases in healthcare, 
    a crucial aspect for accurate diagnosis and predictive analytics. Employing network analysis, we blend theoretical and empirical
    approaches to understand these relationships. Our work primarily focuses on exploring complex network configurations,
    utilizing bipartite models and non-weighted edges to identify significant patterns in disease-symptom interactions.
    A key aspect of our research is the application of novel metrics, inspired by Hidalgo's works from 2007 and 2009, 
    to classify symptoms based on their predictive power and diseases based on their symptomatological complexity. These metrics, along with others 
    like betweenness centrality and community based ones, are instrumental in refining our predictive models and provide a avenue for 
    computational complexity reduction.\\
    Building upon this foundation, we delve into predictive modeling, aspiring to surpass existing benchmarks in the field. 
    Our approach centers on three proven machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron—each chosen
    for their demonstrated effectiveness in disease prediction using symptomatic data, as evidenced in the studies by Kohli, Singh, and Uddin (2019). 
    Through this study, we aim to advance the understanding and capabilities in disease prediction, providing valuable insights for the healthcare sector,
    and to evaluate a graph-based approach for the computational complexity reduction of predictive models.

% ------------------- Goals -------------------

% Description of the goals of the project:
\input{./sections/goals.tex}
% - ML model to predict the disease
% - Network analysis to find the most important symptoms to reduce complexity, and enhance the available features


% ------------------- Methodology and Results Network -------------------

% Methodology used (very technical)
\input{./sections/methodology_network.tex}
% - network creation (adjacency matrix - not weighted - bipartite)
% - hidalgo + significance
% - communities with co-occurrence matrix
% - betweenness centrality

\input{./sections/results_network.tex}
% - degree distribution and power law
% - most important symptoms/diseases (4 classes) 
% - communities
% - L2 has no sense, it's right that z-score low value
% - Meaning of Z-score
% - betweenness centrality
% - clustering coefficient

% ------------------- Methodology and Results ML -------------------

% How we built the ML model 
\input{./sections/methodology_ML.tex}
% - Face the unbalanced dataset problem
% - select best parameters for symptoms one hot only
% - select best parameters for combination of other features (best combination is chosen with random parameters looking at the accuracy)
% - Face the problem of normalization
% - train for each model the two version above with optimal parameters
% - pick the best model according to accuracy

% Results of the ML model (plots and tables)
\input{./sections/results_ML.tex}
% - selected model performances (see which is the worst error or the most commonly misclassified diseases)
% - Compute accuracy and PR AUC
% - Compute the accuracy of the model dividing the data into the 4 classes (HighL1 - HighL2, LowL1 - HighL2, ...)
% - only with one hot symptoms (with optimal parameters both for one hot and other features) 
% - with new features 
% - reduction in computational complexity

% ---------------------- Conclusion -----------------------------

\input{./sections/conclusion.tex}
\input{./sections/future_works.tex}
% - our approach in feature selection and parameters search is not optimal 
% - list the possible issues (e.g. we are training model on diverse features with the optimal parameters for other features)
% - exploit the knowledge of symptoms communities and their most pointed diseases, using it at prior probability for the model classification
