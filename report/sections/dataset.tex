\section{Dataset}

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and is available at the
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhivyeshrk/diseases-and-symptoms-dataset?select=Final_Augmented_dataset_Diseases_and_Symptoms.csv}{following link}.
It comprises disease names along with the symptoms reported by the respective patients.

\noindent
\textbf{Overview:} The dataset encompasses 773 unique diseases and 377 symptoms, resulting in approximately 246,000 rows.
It was artificially generated while preserving Symptom Severity and Disease Occurrence Possibility.

\noindent
\textbf{Data Encoding:} To facilitate model training, the dataset utilizes one-hot encoding for each symptom, transforming
categorical symptom data into a binary format.

\noindent
\textbf{Class Imbalance:} The original dataset exhibited significant class imbalance, with some classes having only one
sample and others containing thousands. We addressed this problem using Oversampling and Undersampling techniques,
and the details are further elaborated in Section \ref{sec:methodology_ML}\ref{subsec:preliminary_data_preparation}.

\noindent
\textbf{Data Cleaning:} To allow consistent Oversampling, classes (diseases) with fewer than three symptoms were excluded
from the dataset, resulting in the removal of 25 classes. Additionally, diseases with no symptoms and symptoms with
no associated diseases were deleted as well.
