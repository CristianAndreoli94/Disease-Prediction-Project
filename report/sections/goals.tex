% - ML model to predict the disease
% - Network analysis to find the most important symptoms to reduce complexity, and enhance the available features

\section{Goals}

The final objective of this project is to develop a robust \textbf{machine learning model} capable of predicting
diseases based on reported symptoms. In pursuit of this goal, \textit{two specific objectives} are outlined,
both centered around \textbf{leveraging the network} structure:\\

\begin{enumerate}

      \item \textbf{New Feature Extraction:} Exploiting the network characteristics and metrics, aiming to
            extract novel features that can enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

      \item \textbf{Complexity Reduction:} Leveraging network information, we aim to reduce
            the number of symptoms, retaining only the most relevant ones. This strategic reduction aims to decrease
            training time while preserving the accuracy of the model.
\end{enumerate}

By integrating these two objectives, the project aspires to not only advance the predictive capabilities of the machine
learning model but also optimize its efficiency in handling the complexities inherent in disease prediction based on symptoms.
